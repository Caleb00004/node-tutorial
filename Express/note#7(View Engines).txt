A View Engine is used to inject some kindoff dynamic data into your HTML.

e.g
Data from a database like blog POST.

View Engine Allows us to write HTML Templates in an HTML syntax, but alos allows us to inject dynamic data and logics.
The Resulting HTML Page with the data is then served to the browser.

We will be using the 'ejs Engine' for this tutorial.(npm install ejs)

// to register your view engine use  app.set()

app.set() let's us to configure some application settings.

syntax.
app.set(''view engine'', 'viewEngine Name')

e.g
// registering view engine.
app.set('view engine', 'ejs')

automatically, express and ejs will look inside a views folder for our different views(HTML pages)
if your views folder is named something else, you can tell express what the folder name is with

app.set('views', 'NameOfFolder')

To render a view
instead of res.sendFile()

it will be
res.render('viewFileName')

Note: Ejs file name should end with an extension '.ejs' i.e 'index.ejs'

You can also pass some data as a second paramter of the render method.
second paramter will be an object that will contain whatever data you wanna pass.

i.e res.render('viewFileName', {name: 'calvin', age: '23'})

The paramter can then be outputed in the ejs view using it's tags <%='title Name' %>

        PASSING DATA TO VIEWS
How to cretae dynamic contemt

we will use ejs tags inside the HTML/ejs file ( <% %> )

Some dynamic Javascript code can then be written inside the ejs tag. similar to how { } works in react
e.g <% const myName = 'Akpan Caleb' %>

when you want to output a code. i.e you want to view the code in browser.
you add equals sign after the first percent tag '%'

<p> <%= myName %> </p>


NOTE: ALL THE FUNCTIONALOTIES OF THE EJS ENGINE IS DONE ON THE SERVER.
        I.E THE EJS RETURNS A VALID HTML TO THE BROWSER WITH ALL THE GETTING AND PASSING OF DATA ALREADY DONE ON THE SERVER.

    IT USES SERVER SIDE RENDERING.

        PARTIALS (think of resuable component in react)
- This are like resuable files or Templates.
kinda like a navbar component in React. but in ejs they are called PARTIALS.
Because they are templates that are used in more than one view.

How to Do This?
- Create a folder, call it partials
- create all the partials files inside.

Then to add the partial file.

use the ejs tags but there would be a minus(-) after the first %.
The include('path/to/partial/file')

<%- include('/path/...')%>

For Partials we are using a minus(-) sign not an equals sing(=) Because..

when we use '=' it escapes special characters. i.e it will return a string value instead of raw HTMl
But '-' dose'nt do that
