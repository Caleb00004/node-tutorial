EXPRESS

- express is basically just a framework that helps us to easily manage our routing, request,
     server side logic and responses in a much easier way.

NOTE: you don't have to use express, you can just do everyting using raw node.

But express makes it easier and faster

INSTALL
npm install -g express

setUP
- import express
define your app with the express function call

- then listen for request

    syntax
const 'importName' = require('express')
const 'importName' = express() 

// Define a get request.
'importName'.get() // takes 2 params, the url path and a callback function
 

// to listen for request
'importName'.listen('portNumber)

// listen for get request
'importName'.get('path', callbackFunc)

i.e 
let's say the 'importName' is express

express.get('/', (req, res) => {
    ...
})

To send back a response,
express will automatically set the staus code for us, so no need to manually do that
express will also automatically set the content-type header for us. so we don't need to manually set it like we do in node

sending back 

NOTE:
But you can manually set the statusCode if you want

example:
res.staus('code').sendFile('path/to/html')
