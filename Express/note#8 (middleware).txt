MIDDLEWARE

- A name for any code that runs(on the server) between getting a request and sending a response

MiddleWare uses examples:
- use it to logger middleware to log details of every request
- Authentication, check middleware for protected routes
- use middleware to parse JSON Data

- we have being using middleware since, the get method is an example of a middleware
 
MiddleWares are mostly written on the top of the code.

But app.use() method is mostly used to define MiddleWares

app.use((req, res) => {
    code...
})

Using next()
- This si used to tell the browser what nect to do after it runs a middleware
- i.e it tells react to move on to the next line or function. 

app.use((req,res,next) => {
    code...
    next()
})

3RD PARTY MIDDLEWARE

syntax for using 3rd party middleware [ app.use('middleware'())  ]
morgan - A logger middleware. it logs out infromation about request

We will be using the morgan middleware (npm install morgan)

- import the middleware ( const morgan = require('morgan'))

Then:
app.use(morgan('dev'))

        STATIC FILES
Static files, (things like a css file, images)

-to make these files available to the browser, you will need to use the static middleware built into express

first 
create a folder (i'm naming it public) then move all your static files inside.

syntax: app.use('importedExpressName'.static('staticFolderName'))

app.use(express.static('public'))
